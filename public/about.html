  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With a comprehensive background in Computer Science, culminating in a Master's degree, I have developed a solid foundation in 
  software development, particularly in Java and Python. My academic projects have prepared me for the practical challenges of 
  software engineering, and I am eager to apply and expand these skills in a dynamic, real-world environment. FDM's commitment 
  to continuous learning and development is particularly appealing to me, as I am committed to lifelong learning and growth in
   my professional career. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to diverse projects and evolve my expertise through 
   FDM's extensive training and development programs</p>
